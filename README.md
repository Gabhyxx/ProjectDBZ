# Project: The Dragon Ball Wiki
## About this project

This in an excercise for ESMAL3 Bootcamp. In this excercise, i've created a "basic-wikipedia" using the Dragon Ball Z API (check credits), where i have 3 different pages. The "main" site, where you have two cards, that link to the next two pages. The "characters" and the "planets" pages, where you can see all the characters and planets from the anime show. There, you have some basic information, for example, an id, a name, etc.

All three webpages have the same header and footer. The header have an icon where links back to the "main" site, plus a text with the name of the full webpage. The footer links to all the "inner pages", and to other webpages.
